## M4A to MP3 Converter
CLI audio format conversion tool from "any format" to MP3. This works well for my downloaded M4a music albums

This is useful for music players that do not support the Apple M4A format

> This script depends on [pydub music library](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub)

***

* Installation
You need to to have Python Installed (2.7.* or 3.*)

Install the Dependencies
```
	pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Put the music M4A files in the same directory as the script and run
```
	python m4a_to_mp3.py
```
at your terminal emulator to convert the songs to the folder you chose.
